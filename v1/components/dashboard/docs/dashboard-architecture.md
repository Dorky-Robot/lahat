# Dashboard Architecture

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the dashboard architecture in Lahat as of March 2025.

## Overview

The dashboard component is responsible for instantiating and managing Lahat cells that contain widgets generated by the widget creation component. Dashboards allow widgets to be composed to fulfill the needs of users.

## Architecture

The dashboard architecture follows the three-layer approach described in the [WebComponent Architecture](../../lahat-webcomponent-architecture.md) document:

1. **WebComponent Layer**: Self-contained, completely unaware of Lahat, focused solely on UI rendering and DOM events
2. **LahatCell Layer**: Manages component lifecycle, handles event communication, acts as a controller, and provides UI integration with Lahat
3. **EventBus Layer**: Handles global event communication (only when needed)

### LahatCell

The LahatCell is a core part of the dashboard component, serving as the container for widgets. It:

1. **Manages WebComponent Lifecycle**: Handles creation, attachment, and destruction of WebComponents
2. **Acts as a Proxy for Events**: Captures events from WebComponents and relays them to the EventBus
3. **Provides UI Integration**: Handles all integration with the Lahat UI
4. **Manages State**: Provides data persistence for WebComponents

See [LahatCell Implementation](./lahat-cell.js) for the detailed implementation.

### Dashboard Grid

The dashboard grid is responsible for arranging LahatCells in a layout. It:

1. **Manages Layout**: Arranges cells in a grid or other layout
2. **Handles Resizing**: Allows cells to be resized
3. **Handles Dragging**: Allows cells to be moved
4. **Manages Cell Communication**: Facilitates communication between cells

### Dashboard Controller

The dashboard controller is responsible for managing the dashboard as a whole. It:

1. **Manages Dashboard State**: Saves and restores the state of the dashboard
2. **Handles User Interactions**: Responds to user actions like adding, removing, or rearranging widgets
3. **Manages Dashboard Configuration**: Handles dashboard settings and preferences
4. **Coordinates with Other Components**: Interacts with other Lahat components as needed

## Implementation Details

The dashboard component is implemented using standard web technologies:

1. **WebComponents**: For encapsulation and modularity
2. **CSS Grid**: For flexible layout
3. **EventBus**: For communication between components
4. **LocalStorage**: For persisting dashboard configuration

## Relationship with Widget Creation

The dashboard component works closely with the widget creation component:

1. **Widget Creation Component**: Generates standalone WebComponents that are independent of Lahat
2. **Dashboard Component**: Instantiates these widgets within Lahat cells and composes them into useful layouts

This separation of concerns allows for:
- Independent development of widgets and dashboards
- Reuse of widgets across multiple dashboards
- Flexible composition of widgets to meet user needs

## Future Enhancements

Planned enhancements for the dashboard component include:

1. **Drag and Drop**: Allow users to rearrange widgets
2. **Widget Marketplace**: Allow users to discover and add new widgets
3. **Dashboard Templates**: Predefined dashboard layouts for common use cases
4. **Dashboard Sharing**: Allow users to share their dashboards with others
5. **Dashboard Analytics**: Track usage patterns to improve user experience
