- [ ] **Develop mini app tests**: Test mini app functionality

## Phase 4: Security Enhancements

Strengthen security across the application:

### Content Security Policy

- [ ] **Audit CSP directives**: Review and update CSP directives for all HTML files
- [ ] **Implement CSP violation reporting**: Add violation reporting for CSP
- [ ] **Remove 'unsafe-inline'**: Eliminate 'unsafe-inline' usage where possible
- [ ] **Implement nonces**: Use nonces for inline scripts when necessary

### Input Validation

- [ ] **Add comprehensive input validation**: Validate all user inputs
- [ ] **Implement content filtering**: Add content filtering for AI prompts

- [ ] **Review path validation**: Enhance path validation for file operations

### Mini App Sandboxing

- [ ] **Enhance sandbox restrictions**: Strengthen sandbox restrictions for mini apps
- [ ] **Implement resource limits**: Add resource limits for mini app windows

- [ ] **Create security boundary validation**: Verify security boundaries are maintained

## Phase 5: Performance Optimization

Optimize performance across the application:

### Rendering Performance

- [ ] **Implement virtual DOM or efficient diff algorithm**: Improve rendering efficiency
- [ ] **Add performance monitoring**: Monitor rendering performance
- [ ] **Optimize CSS selectors**: Review and optimize CSS selectors
- [ ] **Implement code splitting**: Add code splitting for better performance

### Memory Usage

- [ ] **Implement memory usage monitoring**: Monitor memory usage over time
- [ ] **Add memory leak detection**: Detect memory leaks during development

## Implementation Plan

### Priority Ranking

1. **High Priority (Start immediately)**
   - Standardize error handling
   - Improve JSDoc documentation
   - Audit event listeners

2. **Medium Priority (Next quarter)**
   - Set up Jest for unit testing
   - Implement centralized state management
   - Enhance IPC error handling

3. **Lower Priority (Future roadmap)**
   - Implement virtual DOM or efficient diff algorithm
   - Add state time-travel (undo/redo)
   - Create security boundary validation

### Measuring Success

Progress should be measured using these metrics:

- **Code Coverage**: Percentage of code covered by tests
- **Bug Rate**: Number of bugs reported per release
- **Performance Metrics**: Startup time, memory usage, rendering time
- **Developer Feedback**: Satisfaction with codebase maintainability
- **Security Issues**: Number of security vulnerabilities identified

## Conclusion

This refactoring roadmap provides a path to incrementally improve the Lahat codebase without disrupting ongoing development. By focusing on maintainability, performance, security, and testing, the application will become more robust, efficient, and easier to maintain in the long term.

When implementing changes, remember these guiding principles:
1. **Make incremental changes**: Small, focused changes are easier to review and less risky
2. **Add tests before refactoring**: Tests provide a safety net for refactoring
3. **Document changes**: Keep documentation up to date with code changes
4. **Prioritize user impact**: Focus on changes that provide the most benefit to users
5. **Balance technical debt with new features**: Allocate time for refactoring alongside feature development
