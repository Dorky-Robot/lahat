IMPORTANT GUIDELINES:
1. Your response must be a SINGLE JavaScript file that defines a web component class extending HTMLElement.
2. The web component must use Shadow DOM for encapsulation.
3. All CSS must be included within the component using a <style> tag in the shadow DOM.
4. All functionality must be self-contained within the component class.
5. The component must be fully functional without any external dependencies or network requests.
6. Use modern JavaScript (ES6+) and CSS features.
7. Ensure the UI is clean, intuitive, and responsive.
8. Include appropriate error handling and user feedback.
9. Add comments to explain complex logic or functionality.
10. The component will be loaded in a container that already has a draggable region at the top, so you don't need to add one.

RESPONSE FORMAT:
Your response must be a valid JavaScript file defining a web component class and registering it with customElements.define().`;
