# Lahat v2 Documentation

## Overview

This directory contains documentation for the Lahat v2 architecture. Lahat v2 is a modular application that enables users to create, manage, and run mini desktop applications through natural language prompts.

## Module Independence

Each module in Lahat v2 is fully self-contained with no shared code between modules:

- **App Creator**: Contains all components needed for app creation
- **App List**: Contains all components needed for app listing and selection
- **App Manager**: Contains all components needed for app management and execution

## Communication Architecture

- **Inter-Module Communication**: Uses Electron's contextBridge for IPC
- **Intra-Module Communication**: Each module has its own internal communication mechanisms

## Modules

### App Creator Module

The App Creator module is responsible for generating web components based on user prompts. It provides a guided interface for users to describe the application they want to create and uses Claude to generate the necessary code.

### App List Module

The App List module serves as the main entry point to the Lahat application. It displays a list of available mini apps and provides navigation controls to access other parts of the application.

### App Manager Module

The App Manager module is responsible for loading, displaying, and managing the web components generated by the App Creator. It provides a container environment where these components can run safely and communicate with each other through a controlled event system.

## Implementation Approach

The implementation of Lahat v2 will follow an incremental approach:

1. **Project Setup and IPC Infrastructure**: Set up the project structure and implement IPC communication
2. **App List Module**: Implement the app list module
3. **App Creator Module**: Implement the app creator module
4. **App Manager Module**: Implement the app manager module
5. **Integration**: Connect all modules through IPC using Electron's contextBridge

## Migration Strategy

The migration from Lahat v1 to v2 will follow an incremental approach:

1. **Identify v1 components to migrate**: Identify components from v1 that need to be reimplemented in each module independently
2. **Migrate one module at a time**: Start with the App List module, then migrate the App Creator module, and finally implement the App Manager module
3. **Maintain backward compatibility**: Ensure that v2 components can work with v1 components during the transition
4. **Test thoroughly**: Test each migrated component to ensure functionality is preserved

## Getting Started

To get started with the implementation of Lahat v2, follow these steps:

1. Review the [Architecture Overview](./architecture-overview.md) to understand the system architecture
2. Review the [Implementation Guide](./implementation-guide.md) to understand the implementation approach
3. Review the [Todo List](./todo-list.md) to see the detailed list of tasks
4. Start with the implementation of the project structure and IPC infrastructure
