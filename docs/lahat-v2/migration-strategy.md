# Migration Strategy

## Overview

This document outlines the strategy for migrating from the Lahat v1 architecture to the new modular v2 architecture. The migration will be incremental, focusing on one module at a time while maintaining backward compatibility.

## Migration Principles

1. **Incremental Approach**: Migrate one module at a time to minimize risk and allow for continuous delivery.
2. **Backward Compatibility**: Ensure that v2 components can work with v1 components during the transition.
3. **Module Independence**: Ensure each module is fully self-contained with no shared code between modules.
4. **Testing**: Thoroughly test each migrated component to ensure functionality is preserved.

## Migration Phases

### Phase 1: Project Setup and IPC Infrastructure

The first phase focuses on setting up the project structure and IPC infrastructure for module communication.

#### Migration Tasks

1. **Establish module boundaries**
   - Define clear interfaces for each module
   - Identify which functionality belongs to which module
   - Ensure no shared code between modules

2. **Implement IPC infrastructure**
   - Analyze the existing IPC implementation in `v1/modules/ipc/`
   - Create a new IPC system using Electron's contextBridge
   - Define clear API contracts between modules
   - Implement preload scripts for secure communication

### Phase 2: App List Module

The second phase focuses on migrating the App List module.

#### Migration Tasks

1. **Analyze app-list.js**
   - Review the existing implementation in `v1/components/ui/containers/app-list.js`
   - Identify dependencies and interactions with other components
   - Create a migration plan

2. **Create app-list module**
   - Set up the directory structure for the app-list module
   - Create the necessary components
   - Implement the required functionality
   - Test thoroughly

3. **Implement module-specific components**
   - Create all necessary components for the app-list module
   - Ensure no shared code with other modules
   - Test thoroughly

4. **Migrate app-card.js**
   - Review the existing implementation in `v1/components/ui/cards/app-card.js`
   - Create a new implementation in the app-list module
   - Test thoroughly

### Phase 3: App Creator Module

The third phase focuses on migrating the App Creator module.

#### Migration Tasks

1. **Analyze app-creation components**
   - Review the existing implementation in `v1/components/app-creation/`
   - Identify dependencies and interactions with other components
   - Create a migration plan

2. **Create app-creator module**
   - Set up the directory structure for the app-creator module
   - Create the necessary components
   - Implement the required functionality
   - Test thoroughly

3. **Implement module-specific components**
   - Create all necessary components for the app-creator module
   - Ensure no shared code with other modules
   - Test thoroughly

4. **Migrate Claude integration**
   - Review the existing implementation in `v1/claudeClient.js`
   - Create a new implementation in the app-creator module
   - Test thoroughly

### Phase 4: App Manager Module

The fourth phase focuses on implementing the new App Manager module.

#### Migration Tasks

1. **Design app-manager module**
   - Define the requirements for the app-manager module
   - Create a detailed design
   - Review and refine the design

2. **Create app-manager module**
   - Set up the directory structure for the app-manager module
   - Create the necessary components
   - Implement the required functionality
   - Test thoroughly

3. **Implement module-specific components**
   - Create all necessary components for the app-manager module
   - Ensure no shared code with other modules
   - Test thoroughly

4. **Implement LahatApp**
   - Design the LahatApp component
   - Implement the component
   - Test thoroughly

### Phase 5: Integration

The fifth phase focuses on integrating the three modules.

#### Migration Tasks

1. **Implement IPC Communication**
   - Analyze the existing IPC implementation in `v1/modules/ipc/`
   - Create a new IPC system using Electron's contextBridge
   - Implement preload scripts for each module
   - Test thoroughly

2. **Implement navigation**
   - Create a navigation service using IPC
   - Implement window management
   - Test thoroughly

3. **Implement state management**
   - Create a state management service using IPC
   - Implement state persistence
   - Test thoroughly

4. **Implement security**
   - Create a security service
   - Implement content security policies
   - Test thoroughly

## Backward Compatibility

To ensure backward compatibility during the migration, the following strategies will be employed:

1. **Adapter Pattern**: Create adapters that allow v2 components to work with v1 components
2. **Feature Flags**: Use feature flags to enable/disable v2 features
3. **Gradual Rollout**: Roll out v2 components gradually, starting with non-critical components
4. **Fallback Mechanisms**: Implement fallback mechanisms that use v1 components if v2 components fail

## Testing Strategy

The migration will be thoroughly tested at each step:

1. **Unit Tests**: Test individual components
2. **Integration Tests**: Test interactions between components
3. **End-to-End Tests**: Test complete workflows
4. **Backward Compatibility Tests**: Test interactions between v1 and v2 components

## Rollback Plan

In case of issues, the following rollback plan will be implemented:

1. **Identify Issue**: Quickly identify the source of the issue
2. **Isolate**: Isolate the affected component
3. **Rollback**: Revert to the v1 implementation
4. **Fix**: Fix the issue in the v2 implementation
5. **Retry**: Retry the migration with the fixed implementation

## Timeline

The migration will follow this timeline:

1. **Phase 1**: 2 weeks
2. **Phase 2**: 2 weeks
3. **Phase 3**: 2 weeks
4. **Phase 4**: 3 weeks
5. **Phase 5**: 1 week

Total: 10 weeks

## Resources

The following resources will be required for the migration:

1. **Development Team**: 3-4 developers
2. **QA Team**: 1-2 QA engineers
3. **Design Team**: 1 designer
4. **Product Management**: 1 product manager

## Risks and Mitigations

The following risks have been identified:

1. **Scope Creep**: Mitigate by clearly defining the scope and sticking to it
2. **Technical Debt**: Mitigate by refactoring as part of the migration
3. **Resource Constraints**: Mitigate by prioritizing tasks and focusing on high-value items
4. **Integration Issues**: Mitigate by thorough testing and clear interfaces
