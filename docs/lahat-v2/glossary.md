# Glossary

This document provides definitions for key terms used in the Lahat v2 architecture.

## A

### App Creator
The module responsible for generating web components based on user prompts. It provides a guided interface for users to describe the application they want to create and uses Claude to generate the necessary code.

### App List
The module that serves as the main entry point to the Lahat application. It displays a list of available mini apps and provides navigation controls to access other parts of the application.

### App Manager
The module responsible for loading, displaying, and managing the web components generated by the App Creator. It provides a container environment where these components can run safely and communicate with each other through a controlled event system.

## C

### Claude
The AI assistant used by the App Creator to generate web components based on user prompts.

### Component
A reusable piece of UI or functionality that can be composed with other components to create an application.

### Content Security Policy (CSP)
A security standard that helps prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) and other code injection attacks by specifying which dynamic resources are allowed to load.

### CustomEvent
A DOM event that can be created and dispatched by scripts. In Lahat v2, CustomEvents are used to communicate between components through the EventBus.

### CustomEvent Proxy
A component that acts as an intermediary between a web component and the EventBus. It translates events from the web component to the EventBus format, filters events based on security policies, and provides a consistent interface for event communication.

## E

### Electron
The framework used to build the Lahat application. It allows for the creation of desktop applications using web technologies.

### EventBus
The central communication mechanism that allows components to communicate without direct dependencies. It implements a publish-subscribe pattern where components can publish events and subscribe to events from other components.

### Event Proxy
A mechanism that allows events to be forwarded from one component to another. In Lahat v2, event proxies are used to connect web components to the EventBus.

## I

### IPC (Inter-Process Communication)
A mechanism that allows different processes to communicate with each other. In Lahat v2, IPC is used for communication between the main process and renderer processes in Electron, as well as between different modules. Lahat v2 uses Electron's contextBridge for secure IPC.

### contextBridge
A feature in Electron that provides a safe way to expose APIs from a privileged context (like the main process) to a less privileged context (like a renderer process). In Lahat v2, contextBridge is used to implement secure IPC between modules.

### Isolation
A security feature that prevents components from directly accessing each other's resources. In Lahat v2, LahatCells provide isolation boundaries for web components.

## L

### Lahat
The name of the application. Lahat is a Filipino word that means "all" or "everything".

### LahatApp
The main container component that manages the layout and lifecycle of LahatCells. It is responsible for creating and destroying LahatCells, managing the layout of cells, and routing events between cells through the EventBus.

### LahatCell
A container component that hosts a generated web component. It provides lifecycle management, event proxying, isolation, and layout capabilities.

## M

### Mini App
A small, focused application created through the App Creator. Mini apps are implemented as web components and loaded into LahatCells.

### Module
A self-contained unit of functionality in the Lahat v2 architecture. The three main modules are app-creator, app-list, and app-manager. Each module is fully independent with no shared code between modules.

### Module Independence
A design principle in Lahat v2 where each module is fully self-contained with no shared code between modules. This approach reduces cognitive load and allows modules to evolve independently.

## P

### Publish-Subscribe Pattern
A messaging pattern where senders of messages (publishers) do not program the messages to be sent directly to specific receivers (subscribers). Instead, published messages are characterized into classes, without knowledge of which subscribers, if any, there may be. In Lahat v2, the EventBus implements this pattern.

## W

### Web Component
A set of web platform APIs that allow you to create new custom, reusable, encapsulated HTML tags to use in web pages and web apps. In Lahat v2, mini apps are implemented as web components.

### Widget
A small, focused component that provides a specific piece of functionality. In Lahat v2, widgets are displayed in the Widget Drawer and can be added to apps.

### Widget Drawer
A component in the App Manager that displays available widgets that can be added to the current app.
