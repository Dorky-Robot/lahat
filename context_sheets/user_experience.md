    participant App as Main App
    participant Claude as Claude API
    participant MiniApp as Mini App Window
    
    User->>App: Enter app name
    User->>App: Enter app description
    User->>App: Click "Generate Mini App"
    App->>App: Show generation status
    App->>Claude: Send prompt
    
    loop Streaming Response
        Claude->>App: Stream generated code
        App->>User: Update preview
    end
    
    App->>App: Save generated app
    App->>MiniApp: Create and open mini app window
    App->>User: Update app list
    MiniApp->>User: Display generated app
```

1. User enters a name for the mini app
2. User describes the desired app in the prompt textarea
3. User clicks "Generate Mini App"
4. The application shows a loading indicator and begins streaming the response
5. As Claude generates the code, it appears in the preview area
6. Once generation is complete, the app is saved and opened in a new window
7. The app list is updated to include the new app

### Managing Existing Apps

```mermaid

    participant MiniApp as Mini App Window
    
    User->>App: Click on app card
    App->>Modal: Open app details modal
    Modal->>User: Display app details and actions
    
    alt Open App
        User->>Modal: Click "Open App"
        Modal->>MiniApp: Open mini app window
        MiniApp->>User: Display mini app
    else Update App
        User->>Modal: Click "Update App"
        Modal->>User: Show update form
        User->>Modal: Enter update description
        User->>Modal: Click "Submit Update"
